# Ultimate Smashbox - Morrigan Character Integration

## EPIC DEBUGGING BREAKTHROUGH! 🔥

This repository documents our LEGENDARY debugging session where we successfully integrated Morrigan Aensland into the **ULTIMATE SMASHBOX PUBLIC BETA [DirectX]** fighting game engine!

### The Challenge
- Adding Morrigan as the FIRST custom character to the new engine
- Encountered persistent encoding errors with square characters (□□□□□□□)
- Multiple `nohardcodedkeys`, `mapset`, `ifelse`, and encoding issues

### The EUREKA Breakthrough! 💥
**ROOT CAUSE**: The engine doesn't support `nohardcodedkeys` flag!
- **SOLUTION**: Replaced all `flag = nohardcodedkeys` with `flag = noshadow`
- **RESULT**: Successfully passed line 659 and entered Phase 2!

### Technical Fixes Applied - THE STRUGGLE WAS REAL! 💪
1. **TRIGGER1 NIGHTMARE**: Battled through dozens of `trigger1` encoding errors with square characters!
2. **Multiple MAPSET Demons**: Defeated 5+ `mapset` functions by replacing with `varset`
3. **IFELSE Hell**: Fixed complex `ifelse(map(darkforce)>0,1,0)` statements causing □□□□ errors
4. **INCUSTOMSTATE Beast**: Slayed `incustomstate` encoding monster on line 45
5. **PREVMOVETYPE Dragon**: Conquered `prevmovetype != H` encoding issues  
6. **AILEVELF Demon**: Eliminated `AIlevelF` calculation errors
7. **ISASSERTED Hydra**: Destroyed multiple `isasserted` function calls
8. **Encoding Hell**: Removed Windows line endings and 36 invalid Unicode characters
9. **THE BIG ONE - NOHARDCODEDKEYS**: The FINAL BOSS! Engine doesn't support this flag!
10. **EUREKA SOLUTION**: Changed ALL `nohardcodedkeys` to `noshadow` - BREAKTHROUGH!

### The Epic Journey - From TRIGGER1 Hell to Victory! 🎯
**PHASE 1 - TRIGGER1 WARS**: 
- Lines 30, 36, 45, 208, 213, 219, 227, 232, 240, 259, 334, 346, 350... ENDLESS BATTLES!
- Each error was a step closer to victory
- Every □□□□ square was a challenge to overcome
- NEVER GAVE UP - kept pushing through!

**PHASE 2 - THE BREAKTHROUGH**: 
- Reached TRIGGER2 on line 691! 
- `trigger2 = !map(ai_blckhigh)` - NEW TERRITORY!

### Current Status - **HALFWAY TO BURGER TIME!** 🍔
