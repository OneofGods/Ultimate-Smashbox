# 🤝💀 CO-OP CONSULTATION REQUEST 💀🤝

## 🚨 URGENT QUESTION FOR CO-OP:

We've successfully deployed your 514 demon eliminations to production, but user is still seeing:

**Error**: `chars/um/morrigan/states/morisystem.st(30) trigger1 = anim !=cond(map(darkforce) > 0,1,0) map□□□□`

## ✅ WHAT WE CONFIRMED:
- Line 30 IS correctly fixed: `trigger1 = anim != cond(map(darkforce) > 0, 1, 0)` ✅
- File encoding is clean (no CRLF, pure ASCII) ✅ 
- Your mathematical conversions are deployed ✅
- All 8 Morrigan files copied to production location ✅

## ❓ QUESTIONS FOR CO-OP:

1. **Did you encounter `map□□□□` display corruption during testing?**
2. **Is this a known M.U.G.E.N. engine font/charset issue?**
3. **What's the proper way to clear M.U.G.E.N. cache after file changes?**
4. **Should we check moricmd.cns and morihelper.st for additional demons?**
5. **Are there other Morrigan files (.zss, .cns) that need similar fixes?**

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS:
- **Code Level**: DEMON-FREE ✅
- **Display Level**: Still showing corruption symbols 💀
- **User Impact**: Can't verify if Morrigan actually works ⚠️

**Please advise on next debugging steps!** 🔥💀🔥
