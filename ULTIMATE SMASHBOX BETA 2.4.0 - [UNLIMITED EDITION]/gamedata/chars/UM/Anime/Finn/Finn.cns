  				;If omitted, then it defaults to 60 and 40 for integer and float

; Description: This move uses "Trip" for the "ground.type" parameter in
;     its HitDef. It's a special type that puts the opponent in a tripped
;     animation as he falls. Also, the hitflag parameter in the HitDef
;     is set to "MAFD". The "D" indicates that a downed opponent can be
;     hit by the attack.
