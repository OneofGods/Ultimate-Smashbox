=====<Other Info>=====

<Selecting the win pose>
(Speech translations by Kibagami)

A -> Morrigan changes her outfit to one of black leather, sits on some bats and says "Mata
asonde ageru wa!" ("I will play again with you!") or "Waruiko ne!" ("Bad boy (girl)!")
X -> Morrigan scratches her head and either giggles or says "Kimochii deshou"("That felt good")
B or Y -> Morrigan releases a bunch of bats and starts hopping and laughing, while the bats
fly around her
C or Z -> Morrigan flips back and changes to a random outfit. Says one of three speeches:
"Denaoshitoide!" ("Come again!"), "Dou? Kirei deshou?" ("So? Am I beautiful?") or
"Mikakedaoshi ne!" ("You're a mere show!")
